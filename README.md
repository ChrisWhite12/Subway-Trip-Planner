# Software Development Plan

## Purpose and Scope
### what the application will do, what problem does it solve, target audience, how they will use it (300 - 500 words)

My idea for the terminal project is to create an app for a subway. The purpose of this app is to help comuters in travelling on the right train. The program will ask the user for a origin and destination, calculate for the user what time to leave the platform, how many stops before changeover or destination, what time they will arrive and the cost of the ticket. There will be a simple map such as below to remove the complexity of figuring out mutiple paths.

           o------o-------o
                          |            o
                          |            |
                          |            |
                  o-------o------------o--o
                          |            |
                          |            o
                          o

The map will update (clear screen and reprint) to show the animation of the user travelling

the target audience for this app will be comuters travelling on the subway. The app will help them to decide what time to leave and which train to catch. When the app is started the user will input their starting location and the destination. Also that time in which they would like to Depart By or Arrive By.
